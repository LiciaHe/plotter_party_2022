# Call for Participants


We are pleased to invite you to participate in our TEI studio titled Collaborative Creative Coding Through Drawing Robots. Plotters are 3-axis computer numerical control (CNC) machines that have a rich connection to art and image-making. We believe plotters have great potential as a tool to bridge the digital-physical divide, allowing learners from a variety of backgrounds to gain immediate satisfaction from their programming by translating digital output into physical artifacts. In addition, due to their roots in art, plotters may be more inviting to students from artistic backgrounds new to programming.


In this studio, we investigate plotters' potential in introducing creative programming in informal learning environments. By introducing collaborative creative programming through the lens of plotters, we explore solutions to challenges in intro-programming training, collaborative programming, personal fabrication. 

Through the workshop, participants will experience creative coding in digital and physical settings. With the goal of creating a series of four images collaboratively, we will introduce participants to foundational programming concepts using the Python language. We will plot these digital creations during the studio to introduce the benefits and limitations of plotters. Participants will receive the physical plots after the studio.
	

This call is open for those interested in exploring creative programming through the lens of plotters. No previous coding experience is required. This four-hour studio will be conducted both online. Participants can choose to attend through Zoom.
