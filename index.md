# Collaborative Creative Coding Through Drawing Robots

With the development of end-user fabrication technology, plotters have become increasingly accessible and attractive to a broader community. Since their invention, these 3-axis CNC machines have been connecting digital and analog creation. Plotters have great potential as a tool to bridge the digital-physical divide, allowing learners from a variety of backgrounds to gain immediate satisfaction from their programming by translating digital output into physical artifacts. In addition, due to their roots in art, plotters may be more inviting to students from artistic backgrounds new to programming.

In this studio, we investigate plotters' potential in introducing creative programming in collaborative learning environments. By introducing collaborative creative programming through the lens of plotters, we explore solutions to challenges in programming education, collaborative programming, and personal fabrication.
